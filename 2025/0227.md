# CW complexes part 1

Today's goal is to define CW complexes as a topological construction and deduce some clean properties. This part mainly follows Shastri, Ch2.

**Definition 1.** Fix $k\geq 1$. Given a topological space $X$ and a family of maps $f_i:S^{k-1}\to X$, $i\in I$, by attaching $k$-cells to $X$ we mean the pushout diagram

Based on [the last post](https://caelestia.github.io/2025/0223.html), we immediately get

- $X$ is a closed subset of $Y$, and
- Let $\phi_i$ be the right map restricted to each $k$-disk. These are sometimes called the *characteristic maps*. Then each *open cell* in $Y$, defined as $\phi_i(\operatorname{int}D^k)$, is homeomorphic to $\operatorname{int}(D^k)$ via $\phi_i$.
- However, in general a *closed cell* $\operatorname{im}(\phi_i)$, denoted as $e_i$, need not be homeomorphic to a disk.

**Lemma 2.** We have

1. A subset $A\subset Y$ is closed iff $A\cap X$ is closed in $X$ and every $A\cap e_i$ is closed in $e_i$.
1. If $X$ is Hausdorff, then the closed cells are closed in $Y$.

> Proof. The 'only if' is trivial as $X$, $e_i$'s are subsets. To see the other direction, notice that $A\cap e_i$ is closed in $e_i$ implies $\phi_i^{-1}(A)$ is closed in $D^k$, then use that $Y$ is a quotient space.

The following argument depicts the similarity of $Y$ and $X$.

For a subset $B\subset S^{k-1}$, we define

$$N_\varepsilon(B):=\{x\in D^k:\vert x\vert>\varepsilon\,\wedge\,\frac{x}{\vert x\vert}\in B\},$$

where $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$. This extends $B$ into $D^k$ in a consistent way.

Applying this construction on $X$, we choose any function $\varepsilon:I\to(0,1)$. Define, for any subset $A\subset X$,

$$N_\varepsilon(A):=A\cup\bigcup_{i\in I}\phi_i\circ N_{\varepsilon(i)}\circ\phi_i^{-1}(A).$$

Clearly,

- $N_\varepsilon(A)\cap X=A$.
- $N_\varepsilon(A)\cap N_\varepsilon(B)=N_\varepsilon(A\cap B)$, for two subsets $A$, $B$.
- $N_\varepsilon(A)$ is open in $Y$ iff $A$ is open in $X$.
- $A$ is a SDR of $N_\varepsilon(A)$.
