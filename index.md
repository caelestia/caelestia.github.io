## Hello

各位, 早上好, 中午好, 晚上好.

This is my blog for casual,
everyday math topics. Also, an attempt to keep me writing down stuff and doing exercises. 

Still figuring out how to write in English.

<!-- I'm also working on a slightly more well-ordered notes on analysis and differential geometry at [Calculus](https://github.com/caelestia/Calculus). -->

Find me at [github](https://github.com/caelestia). Please tell me if anything I wrote is wrong.
