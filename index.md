## Hello

各位, 早上好, 中午好, 晚上好.

This is my random blog for casual,[^1]
everyday math topics. In other words, this is an attempt to keep me writing down stuff and doing exercises, interesting or not. 

[^1]: 可能会出现中文. or worse.

I'm also working on a slightly more well-ordered notes on analysis and differential geometry at [Calculus](https://github.com/caelestia/Calculus).

Find me at [github](https://github.com/caelestia), or QQ 2150341750, if necessary.
