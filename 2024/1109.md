# Paracompact spaces and partition of unity

Today we prove the following fact:

**Theorem.** If $X$ is $T_1$, TFAE:

- $X$ is paracompact and Hausdorff;
- Every open cover of $X$ admits a subordinate partition of unity.


By paracompact we mean every open cover $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ of $X$ has a locally finite refinement. Note that

**Proposition 1.** If $\{V_j\}_{j\in J}$ is a locally finite refinement of $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ with another index set $J$, then there exists a locally finite refinement with index set $I$.

> Proof. Let $f:J\to I$ be so that $V_j\subset U_{f(j)}$ for all $j$. Indeed, the induced refinement
>
> $$\left\{\bigcup_{j\in f^{-1}(i)}V_j\right\}_{i\in I}$$
>
> is locally finite.

A partition of unity means a family of continuous functions $\{\lambda_i:X\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\}_{i\in I}$, satisfying

1. The open sets $\{\lambda_i^{-1}(\mathbb{R}_{>0})\}_i$ form a locally finite cover of $X$, and
2. $\sum_i\lambda_i$ is non-vanishing over $X$.

Since $\sum\lambda_i$ is non-vanishing, we may as well require it to be the constant $1$ on $X$. 

Condition 1. can be equivalently states as

1. The closed sets $\{\operatorname{supp}(\lambda_i)\}_i$ form a locally finite cover of $X$.     

We say the partition of unity is subordinate to $\{U_i\}_i$ if $\operatorname{supp}(\lambda_i)\subset U_i$ holds for all $i$.
