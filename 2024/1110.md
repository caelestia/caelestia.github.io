# Exercise (Global Calculus) Complex vector bundle?


I know I don't really understand these things.

**Ch 2, Exercise 4.** Treat a complex vector bundle $E\to M$ of rank $n$ as a real bundle of rank $2n$. Then $E\otimes_\mathbb{R}\mathbb{C}\simeq E\oplus\overline{E}$.

First we have to understand what this means. $E\otimes_\mathbb{R}\mathbb{C}$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-vector bundle of rank $2n$. On the other side is the direct sum of $E_{\mathbb{C}}$ and its base change by complex conjugation $\overline{\ \cdot\ }:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$.

The corresponding algebraic problem is the following.

**Proposition.**
