# Galois Exercise 2

**Q.** Let $F$ be any field and $K=F(X)$. Prove that any subextension $F\subset L\subset K$ either has $K\vert L$ is finite, or $L=F$.

Find $\operatorname{Aut}_F(K)$.

> Proof. The first part amounts to proving that for any $f\in K\setminus F$,
>
> $$[K:F(f)]=[F(X):F(f)]<\infty.$$
>
> We can in fact find the minimal polynomial of $X$ over $F(f)$. Let $f=g/h$ where $g$, $h\in F[X]$ are coprime. Clearly $fh(T)-g(T)\in F(f)[T]$ has $X$ as a root. Therefore $[K:F(f)]<\infty$.

>
> We can directly check that this is a group homomorphism&mdash;I don't know a better way&mdash;and its kernel is just $F$. Therefore $\operatorname{Aut}_F(K)=\operatorname{PGL}_2(F)$.
